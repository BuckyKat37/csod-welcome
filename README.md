# csod-welcome
A repository for code that I use at my job at the Ounce of Prevention to make our welcome pages in Cornerstone OnDemand responsive and a little bit smarter. Hopefully this repository can serve as a place to share my work with other CSOD admins who are similarly working on ways to present a flexible experience to users.

I intend to use a ridiculous amount of comments in the code that I share so that anyone interested may pull out the useful bits for their own organizations.  And while I fully expect that this project will amount to just me using Git for version control and /some/ sharing, I would be happy to take in any recommendations.

To use the code in this repository, you will need:
- Conrerstone OnDemand
- The ability to use JavaScript and CSS in your portal welcome pages. This can be done by contacting Cornerstone Support and signing an acknowledgement that you and your organization are aware of the security risks posed by allowing arbitrary JavaScript. (Make sure that anyone in your organization that works in CSOD is also aware of the risks.)

This repository will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the use of external libraries. It's not that Bootstrap and jQuery are cool, but they also make it harder for me to know what is going on.
